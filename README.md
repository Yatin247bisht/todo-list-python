# todo-list-python
A simple CLI-based To-Do List app in Python
I recently developed a simple yet functional To-Do List application using Python. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of key programming concepts like:

🔹 User input handling
🔹 Conditional logic
🔹 Loops and lists
🔹 Menu-driven interfaces
🔹 Error handling

🛠️ The app allows users to:

*Add new tasks

*View current tasks

*Delete tasks

*Exit the program with clean prompts
