# todo-list-python
A simple CLI-based To-Do List app in Python
I recently developed a simple yet functional To-Do List application using Python. This project helped me strengthen my understanding of key programming concepts like:

🔹 User input handling
🔹 Conditional logic
🔹 Loops and lists
🔹 Menu-driven interfaces
🔹 Error handling

🛠️ The app allows users to:

Add new tasks

View current tasks

Delete tasks

Exit the program with clean prompts

While it's a console-based app now, I'm planning to upgrade it by:
➡️ Adding file saving/loading
➡️ Introducing task priorities and deadlines
➡️ Possibly converting it into a GUI with Tkinter

This was a great way to reinforce the fundamentals of Python. If you're starting out or learning how to build CLI-based tools, a project like this is a fantastic way to get hands-on.

Would love to hear your thoughts or feedback!
